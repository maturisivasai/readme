**Projects:**

1.Prediction of Rainfall Using Machine Learning Techniques:

Journal link:https://www.ijstr.org/final-print/jan2020/Prediction-Of-Rainfall-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques.pdf

This project concentrated on estimation of rainfall and it is estimated that Support Vector Regression(SVR) is a valuable and adaptable strategy, helping the client to manage the impediments relating to distributional properties of fundamental factors, geometry of the information and the normal issue of model over fitting.

Used the matplotlib for the visualization of results and used the Python packages Pandas,Numpy.

Performed the data cleaning and preprocessing replaced the null values with mean values and done the feature scaling.

Additionally process Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for both MLR and SVR models to assess execution of the models.

The tuned SVR model gives the best results compared to MLR and SLR because of the capability of handling nonlinearity in data.

2.Book Recommendation System Based on Amazon Reviews:

Amazon s3 bucket is used to store and retrieve the data from databricks and implemented in Databricks using python and PowerBI is for visualization of results that we extract from rawdata.

 Collect the data from the kaggle and after performing data preprocessing in this process we remove the null values and only consider the top 30 categories of books because 80% data is covered by this categories.

After data preprocessing we perform the exploratory data analysis to extract the useful insights from the rawdata.

Before building the model we perform feature selection to select key features to build the model and then build the recommendation model using content based filtering and collaborative based filtering and hybrid model.
