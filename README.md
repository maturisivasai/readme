With a Master's degree in Computer Science and 3 years of professional experience as a Data Analyst at Tata Consultancy Services, I believe I could make a significant contribution to your team.
During my tenure at Tata Consultancy Services, I had the opportunity to work with Morgan Stanley as a Data Analyst. I gained hands-on experience in data cleaning, feature scaling, and creating interactive dashboards using Python packages and Tableau. I also honed my skills in SQL for data handling and CRUD operations, and used AWS Redshift for storing and retrieving reports from the Data Warehouse.


In addition to my professional experience, I have completed several academic projects that have further developed my data analysis skills. Notably, I worked on a project predicting rainfall using Machine Learning techniques, where I utilized Python packages for data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization of results. I also built a book recommendation system based on Amazon reviews, where I implemented the model in Databricks using Python and used PowerBI for visualization and S3 bucket for storing processed data.


I am proficient in several programming languages including Java, C, SQL, Python, HTML5, CSS3, Scala, and Spark. I am also familiar with web technologies such as JavaScript and MVC Framework, and have experience with databases like MySQL. I am comfortable working with tools like Eclipse, GitHub, MS Office, Jupyter Notebook, and JIRA, and have experience with Windows and Linux platforms.


I hold certifications in Introduction to Data Science by Cisco, Cloud Infrastructure Technologies by Linux Foundation, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) by Microsoft. These certifications, along with my academic and professional experiences, have equipped me with a strong foundation in data analysis and problem-solving.


I am excited about the possibility of bringing my unique blend of skills and experience to your team. I am confident that my passion for problem-solving and data visualization, coupled with my commitment to transforming complex data into insightful, actionable strategies, will enable me to add significant value to your organization.
